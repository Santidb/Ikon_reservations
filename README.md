# Ikon_reservations

This is a web automation tool to check if there are reservations available for any resort on the ikon pass
website, and alerts the user if reservations are available on the selected dates.

Tool is not fully built out. Username and password, dates and resorts all have to be manually input into the code.
If the bot finds reservations for any of the required dates, it goes ahead and makes the reservation. It will keep
running until all days are reserved.
